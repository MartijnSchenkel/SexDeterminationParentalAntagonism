This folder contains the files needed to generate Figure 3. Note that the simuled data are generated
using 2024_08_06_figure_3_code.R (in e.g. R/RStudio). The resulting files are labelled Figure_3.pdf or 
Figure_3.png, which can be can be incorporated into the 2023_10_20_Figure_3C.svg file (in e.g. 
Inkscape). This effectively generates Figure 3. I include the 2024_08_06_Figure_3C_incl_graph.svg 
file which contains my version.
