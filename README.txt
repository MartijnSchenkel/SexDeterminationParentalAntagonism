This archive contains the source code, secondary data sets, analysis files and output files 
(figures, in PNG/PDF/SVG formats). Raw data is not included due to their excessive file sizes, hence
some parts of the analysis scripts may not work. Using the secondary data files however allows one 
to redo the analyses described in the manuscript. Fitting the GAMs can take hours, and similarly 
generating the predictions using these GAMs can also take a fair bit of time.

Note that data, scripts, and output are grouped per figure in the manuscript, with one folder 
containing all associated material per each figure. Source code for the model is provided as 
"source_code.R" in the "source" folder.
