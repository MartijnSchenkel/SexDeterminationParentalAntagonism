# Archive information #
# =================== #

This data archive is structured in a way that it is clear how the various files are used to generate
specific elements from the manuscript. This means that most data, analysis scripts, and output files
are ordered into folders that correspond to specific figures from the main text or supplementary 
material. These folders are:

/Figure_1
  Contains SVG files (source) for Figure 1, and PDF and PNG versions of said figure. The .SVG files
  can be opened using e.g. Inkscape, which is freely available online through https://inkscape.org.

/Figure_2
  Contains various folders outlining the data, analysis scripts, etc. that are used to generate 
  Figure 2. A separate README.txt file is included with further details.

/Figure_3
  Contains the data, analysis scripts, etc. that are used to generate Figure 3. A separate 
  README.txt file is included with further details.

/Figure_4
  Contains various folders outlining the data, analysis scripts, etc. that are used to generate 
  Figure 2. A separate README.txt file is included with further details.

/manuscript
  Contains the final manuscript, and a .doc of the final submitted version of the manuscript.

/source_code
  Contains the source code in .R format for the simulations performed in this manuscript. This file
  can be opened using R/RStudio, which are freely available online through 
  https://cran.r-project.org/ (for R) and https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ (for RStudio).
  Comments in the source code provide further details on its usage.

/supplementary_figures
  Contains various folders outlining the data, analysis scripts, etc. used to generate Supplementary
  Figures 1 through 3. This folder does not contain an additional README.txt file; instead, the 
  folder /Supplementary_Figure_1 contains an annotated version of the source code that yields the
  resulting Supplementary Figure 1 in .PDF and .PNG format. Likewise, there is an annotated analysis
  script in the /Supplementary_Figures_2_3 folder that can be used to generate Supplementary Figures
  2 and 3.
